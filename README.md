<h2>About me</h2>

I am Shivani Singh. I am doing B.Tech in CSE from Indira Gandhi Delhi Technical University for Women (IGDTUW).I am very keen to learn new technologies and use them to either create something useful or improve the existing softwares.   
âš¡ Fun fact: I love to connect with people and learn about their journey, it helps me to open up my mind for different perspectives on various domains.   
ðŸ’¬ Ask me anything, I will be more than happy to help :D
